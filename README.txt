Description:
Contained here is a walkthrough of the Realpython.com tutorial for webscraping
(https://realpython.com/python-web-scraping-practical-introduction/). The goal
of this exercise is for me to build a resource such that I can learn the 
dictionary words in the summary included on the Investopedia page. This will 
hopefully allow me to gain a lot of insight into the finance world and 
eventually start my own company.
